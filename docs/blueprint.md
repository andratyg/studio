- Accent color: Transparent gray (#80808040) with backdrop-filter blur for cards (Glassmorphism).
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for regular text to give a modern, readable feel.
- Technical elements font: 'Fira Code' (monospace) for code snippets and technical info for programmer feel.

- Use minimalist icons for social media links and tech stack. Icons should subtly animate on hover.
